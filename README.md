# Amsterdam Airbnb
Data used from Kaggle on an Amsterdam Airbnb. This was a Capstone Project that was completed during my Introduction to Data Science Summer Course at Georgetown University. Through this course, I was able to learn the basics of Python, data wrangling, data visualization, and data modeling. 

Individual Contributions:
- Created correlation heat map and wrote down findings
- Created histogram for Guests Included data 
- Contributed towards determining significance of findings and brainstorming general organization of project
